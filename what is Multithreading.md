# *what is Multi threading ?
 
 In multi threading we create multiple threads.it allow us to execute multiple threads simultaneously,it is just thread based multitasking.
## for example:
In vlc  media player we use three threads simultaneously one for open vlc
media player,second for play song and third for add new song. ![](Multithreading.png)
